What is Rapicoin Core?
----------------------

Rapicoin Core connects to the Rapicoin peer-to-peer network to download and fully
validate blocks and transactions. It also includes a wallet and graphical user
interface (GUI), which can be optionally built.

Rapicoin is designed for faster transactions â€” a new block is created every **1 minute**,
enabling quicker confirmations compared to Bitcoin's 10-minute block time.

Further information about Rapicoin Core is available in the [doc folder](/doc).
